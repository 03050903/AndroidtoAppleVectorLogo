# AndroidtoAppleVectorLogo


This project is an Android app demoing the use of AnimatedVectorDrawables to morph vector graphics within an android app. It is compatible with Android version 5.0(Lollipop) and above.
I've also written an [article explaining the process of making this](https://lewismcgeary.github.io/posts/animated-vector-drawable-pathMorphing/).
